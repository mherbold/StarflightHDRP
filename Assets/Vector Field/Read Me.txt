You can launch the window from Window > Vector Field Lite

You can create a 3D Texture from scratch

And then create each arrow or duplicate an arrow from
 Edit > Duplicate Arrow or using the Ctrl+Shift+D shortcut
And you can create arrows based on selected objects in the
 scene by using the Selected to Arrows button

When you are happy with the result you can name the texture 
 and click Apply Arrows and Save button which will create a
 texture in the Asset folder

There is a tutorial video on Youtube:

This is the free "Lite" version of the asset which is limmited by
 15 arrows at a time, and doesn't have the Import feature which gives
 the ability to import other 3D Textures and modify them
